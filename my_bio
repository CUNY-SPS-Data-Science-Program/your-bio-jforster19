Hi I'm Josh Forster pursuing this Master's in Data Science at CUNY. I live and work in NJ as a data analyst at a financial services firm where I help analyze brokerage operations data. 
With broad access to information I have a decent number of opportunities to visualize data and I'm hopeful to learn new techniques to further enhance my decision making and abilities to tell a good story. 
I typically use Tableau at work, but I'm excited to improve my familiarity with Python and R packages that are more suited for advanced analystics.
